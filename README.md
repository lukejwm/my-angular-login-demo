# Angular 14 Web Application (Login & Registration) Seed Project 

This seed project is a refactored version of the Angular 10 User Registration and Login project (see https://jasonwatmore.com/post/2020/07/18/angular-10-user-registration-and-login-example-tutorial for details). 

For our purposes, the original project has been updated from Angular 10 to 14, with the files being slightly restructured. We will need to ensure that the project is updated to the latest version of Angular (i.e. will need to be updated every 6 months) and must also be compatible with the latest LTS version of Node (currently v16.17.0) - NB: ONLY use the LTS version of Node.  

TODO: Update the CSS so that we use our own Allied Offsets CSS template instead of the boring default Bootstrap template! 

It is expected that we will likely have many more web app projects in the future, so this is being kept in our "project template library" to help with productivity. Obviously, this cannot be used as a final product as it is only a seed project. 

This will go together with our "seed backend project" that is a very simple microservice using Scala, Akka HTTP and Gradle.
